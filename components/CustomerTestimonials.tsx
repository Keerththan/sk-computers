      "The Quality of service is impeccable. The staff is both knowledgeable and helpful. I have been using the services for six years now and it has been a trouble free and rewarding experience. We need more branches of SK computers in more GTA areas in order to make their services accessible to all computer users- both for professional and personal usage. THANK YOU SK",

      "Wonderful experience!!! I had issue with laptop screen. I spoke to Suthan and explained situation that i can come after six pm from my work by the time he closes shop. Also, since laptop is used for university, i required it back same day. I reached his shop after 6:30, he still waited. Not only that he fixed my laptop staying longer time and gave it back on same day. Very helpful and very customer friendly experience üëèüëè",

      "Excellent service for a very reasonable price. The man gave me a free assessment and the estimate. He completed the work (fix) in just a few days. He had saved me the cost of buying another laptop. When I mentioned it to another coworker and she told me that she goes to this place for all her tech issues, and she is also very happy with the service.",
